# Theme

This file defines the theme for the website and some default styles.

There are two themes on the website:

- Light
- Dark

The default theme will be selected using the [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) property.

Along with the theme you'll find `sprinkles-dark.json` which serves as the syntax highlighting theme for the blog posts.
