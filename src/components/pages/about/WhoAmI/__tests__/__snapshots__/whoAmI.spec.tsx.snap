    I love working in between product, engineering and developer experience. Some things that make me excited are JavaScript, Open Source, CI & CD systems, simplicity, automating things and building meaningful user-centric products.

    I was born and raised in Badalona next to the mediterranean sea and come from a background of studying Computer Science.
