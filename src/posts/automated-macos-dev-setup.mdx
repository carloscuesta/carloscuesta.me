One of my first GitHub open source projects I created 10 years ago was my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles) repository. Everything started as a place to store my configuration files as a backup and a way to showcase my setup with friends.

Since then, it has evolved into an ever-changing collection of scripts, tools, and configurations files I use to set up my development environment.

A few weeks ago, I decided to completely rewrite my dotfiles with a tool called [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) and it has been a complete game changer! 🤯

### Table of Contents

### Where I'm coming from

For years, I managed my dotfiles with a [handcrafted shell script system](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles/tree/8349276b50adcea534ecad2a84b7d173ab2d94a6). Those scripts, created the dotfiles, prompted for user input and installed software through [brew](http://brew.sh).

It worked well for a good while, but it had a few limitations that I was not happy with:

- **Complex to maintain**: As my setup changed, the scripts were getting more complex over time, and I was spending too much time maintaining them. Debugging failures wasn't always straightforward.
- **Machine-to-machine differences**: I use different machines (personal and work) each with different needs and configurations.
- **Difficult to track changes**: When I made updates to the repo, I had to remember to run the setup script on all machines often skipping certain steps to avoid overwriting local changes.

### Where I'm at now

I finally decided to give [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io) a try after hearing about it many times and I'm so glad I did 😍. It has **completely changed the way** I **manage** my **dotfiles**.

With just a **single command**, I can setup a fresh machine into my complete personal environment, with all my **dotfiles**, **applications**, **tools** and **system settings** included.

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles/master/.setup.sh | bash
```

I know, it feels like magic! 🪄, but let me show you how it works 🤓. You can follow along using my [dotfiles repository](http://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles).

### Dotfiles

Dotfiles store configuration for many tools and apps on the system, from the shell to the editor, Git SSH, you name it. Chezmoi works by creating a **1:1 mapping** between the **files** in your **repository** and their **destination** on your **system**.

Files prefixed with a `dot_` are treated as _dotfiles_. For example, a file named `dot_zshrc` in the repo will be created as `~/.zshrc` on your machine. By default, all files in the repository are managed by chezmoi, unless explicitly ignored.

```

</details>

Looking at the tree above, you can start to see how dotfiles will be structured once applied to the system. But **there's more**, did you notice `.tmpl` files? 👀

**Template files**

The `.tmpl` files are [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) that allow you to generate dotfiles with **dynamic content**, like environment variables, user input or other system information.

For example, `dot_config/git/config.tmpl` is a **template** that gets **compiled** **into** a proper Git config **file** based on predefined variables and user prompts:

mention this is based on prompts and variables (not sure if remove the reference to dot_ssh/config.tmp)

```bash title="dot_config/git/config.tmpl"
[user]
  name = Carlos Cuesta
  email = {{ .email }}
  signingkey = {{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}/.ssh/{{ .gitSigningKeyName }}.pub
```

Once the dotfiles are applied, `chezmoi` will replace the `{{ .variables }}` with the actual values. You can define variables and prompts in the [`.chezmoi.<format>.tml`](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/special-files/chezmoi-format-tmpl/) file.

```bash title=".chezmoi.json.tmpl"
{
  "data": {
    "email": {{ promptString "What is your email" | quote }},
    "setSshKey": {{ promptBool "Do you want to set up an SSH key" }},
    "gitSigningKeyName": "id_github"
  }
}
```

The [templating engine](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/) is very powerful and there's a lot you can do with it, including: conditionals, functions and more.

This lets you keep your dotfiles clean, **portable**, and **tailored to each machine**, without hardcoding sensitive data or environment-specific settings.

### Hooks

Another key part of the setup is **installing software**, **tools**, and applying macOS system settings. This is where [hooks](https://www.chezmoi.io/reference/configuration-file/hooks/) come into play, they let you automate tasks, like running scripts at the different stages of the setup process.

Here's how I use them in my setup:

#### Apply macOS system defaults

I've been using macOS for more than 15 years now, and I’m very picky about how my system is configured. From keyboard layout to trackpad, finder and dock settings, there are a bunch of preferences I always change to match my workflow.

Instead of applying these manually every time, I use a [**run once hook**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles/blob/master/run_once_after_setup-system-settings.sh.tmpl) to automate it all. It makes the experience of setting up a new mac easy and consistent, every single time.

```bash title="run_once_after_setup-system-settings.sh.tmpl"
{{- if eq .chezmoi.os "darwin" }}
echo "🍏  Setting macOS defaults"
defaults write ...
{{ end -}}
```

#### Install apps, tools and packages

I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) alongside an inline [Brewfile](https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile) to install all the apps, tools, and packages I need to provision my development environment.

Instead of installing them manually, I use a [**run on change hook**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles/blob/master/run_onchange_brew-packages.sh.tmpl) that runs every time the `Brewfile` changes.

```bash title="run_onchange_brew-packages.sh.tmpl"
{{- if eq .chezmoi.os "darwin" -}}
brew bundle --file=/dev/stdin <<EOF
brew "..."
cask "..."
EOF
{{ end -}}
```

#### Install shell packages

Last but not least another [**run on change hook**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles/blob/master/run_onchange_install-shell-packages.sh) to install zsh plugins and Ghostty themes, to make my terminal look like this:

### Setup script

To **glue** everything together, I have a simple shell script that I can run via curl. This script is the entry point to my dotfiles and it's responsible for:

1. Installing `xcode` command line tools.
2. Installing `brew`.
3. Installing `oh-my-zsh`.
4. Installing `chezmoi`.
5. Initializing dotfiles or update them if they're already set up.

```bash title=".setup.sh"
#!/bin/bash
set -eufo pipefail
echo "🚀  Setting up @carloscuesta dotfiles."

if xcode-select -p &> /dev/null; then
  echo "✅  Xcode command line tools are already installed."
else
  echo "🔧  Installing Xcode command line tools..."
  xcode-select --install &> /dev/null
  echo "✅  Xcode command line tools installed successfully."
fi

if which -s "brew"; then
  echo "✅  Homebrew is already installed."

  echo "🍺  Installing Homebrew"
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  echo "✅  Homebrew installed successfully."
fi

if [ -f ~/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh ]; then
  echo "✅  oh-my-zsh is already installed."
else
  echo "💻  Installing oh-my-zsh"
  yes | sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
  echo "✅  oh-my-zsh installed successfully."
fi

if which -s "chezmoi"; then
  echo "✅  Chezmoi is already installed."
else
  echo "⚪️  Installing Chezmoi"
  brew install chezmoi
fi

if [ -d "$HOME/.local/share/chezmoi/.git" ]; then
  echo "ℹ️  Chezmoi already initialized, pulling latest changes..."
  chezmoi update
  echo "✅  Chezmoi updated"
else
  chezmoi init carloscuesta
  chezmoi apply
  echo "✅  Chezmoi initialized"
fi
```

</details>

### Conclusion

I'm very satisfied with how my new dotfiles management system turned out. It's way more **simple**, **scalable** and **flexible** than what I had before.

If you're on the fence about trying out `chezmoi` I genuinely recommend giving it a go. Start small and build up from there.

Let me know if you end up using it, I’d love to see your setup! 😍
