**Metaprogramming** is a technique where we write code to manipulate other code. I know this sounds a bit intimidating and confusing üò±, but actually I'm sure you've already used it in your daily work.

Have you ever used a transpiler, a linter or a code formatter, such as: [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [ESLint](http://eslint.org) or [Prettier](http://prettier.io)? If the answer is yes, then you've already used [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)! üëè

In this article I'm going to explain how you can use **codemods** (_metaprogramming_) to perform large-scale refactors to a codebase. Let's dive into it! ü§ø

### What is Codemod?

[Codemod](https://github.com/facebookarchive/codemod) is a tool that helps you with large-scale refactors by **running transformation** on your **codebase programatically**. 

This automated transformations will allow you to change large amount of files without having to go through them manually, **saving** a lot of **time** and **increasing** **confidence**! üôå

It was developed by Facebook around 2008. Here's a great talk by [Cristoph Nakazawa](https://twitter.com/cpojer) explaining how they use codemods to [incrementally evolve Facebook's codebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0pOgY8__JM).
