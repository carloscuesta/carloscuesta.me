**[React Amsterdam](https://react.amsterdam)** is a full day conference on all things React. The biggest conference I've ever been with more than 1000 developers from all across the 🌍. I went with two workmates from **[Ulabox](https://ulabox.com)** [@sospedra_r](https://twitter.com/sospedra_r) and [@juanmaorta](http://twitter.com/juanmaorta). The event was organized in two tracks: **React** & **React Native**.

### Getting started

The conference day started with a _React Amsterdam_ ⛴ that moved the attendees and speakers from Amsterdam Centraal Station to the venue location that was a beautiful place called [Kromhouthal](http://kromhouthal.com).

Once registered, a bag with a cool t-shirt some stickers and a notebook was given to every person at the conference. Then the breakfast started with a big selection of coffe, fruits and baked goods. ☕️

### Venue and talks

The event was mainly focused at the **React** track, the difference between the stages was really noticeable. But didn't make any difference on the quality of the talks. Due to my needs I've moved between the two tracks. Overall **the technical level** was **really good** 🔝. I learnt something in each presentation, solved some problems and got a ton of ideas.

All **talks were recorded** and **live streamed** through the [React Amsterdam youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw). Be sure to take a look into it! A lot of interesting things going on here ☝️.

**My top 5 favourite talks are**:

- ⭐️ Performance Limitations of React Native and How to Overcome Them – [@koltal](https://twitter.com/koltal) – 🎥 [Ṣlides](https://speakerdeck.com/talkol/performance-limitations-of-react-native-and-how-to-overcome-them-1)
- ⭐️ Universal React – [@grabbou](https://twitter.com/grabbou)
- ⭐️ Web Like Release Agility for React Native Apps – [@nparashuram](https://twitter.com/nparashuram) – 🎥 [Ṣlides](https://docs.com/parashuram-np/9315/reactconf17-parashuram)
- ⭐️ Asynchronous & Offline Magic Tricks on React Native – [@WoodyRousseau](https://twitter.com/WoodyRousseau) – 🎥 [Ṣlides](http://slides.com/woodyrousseau/deck-2-3/)
- ⭐️ Styling React/ReactNative Applications – [@mxstbr](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) – 🎥 [Ṣlides](https://speakerdeck.com/mxstbr/styling-react-applications)

The **lunch** and **dinner** catering was a bit of a **mess**, the **food** was super **healthy** and **tasteful** but there **wasn't enough** to feed +1000 people. Even at the closing talk a lot of people left the stage to find something to eat 🌮.

### Conclusion

As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed the conference and I'm very happy with the talks. Also, I encourage you to **join the next edition** if you are **into** the **React game** ⚛️.

Huge thanks to **[Ulabox](https://ulabox.com)** ❤️ for giving us the oportunity to attend React Amsterdam! 🇳🇱 ✈️
