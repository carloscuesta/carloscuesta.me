---

As 2016 has come to an end, I would like to write a post reviewing my year and keep this as an habit.

2016 was a year full of new things, at the very beginning of the year I started my blog, the place where I'm writing this post now. I've been doing a lot of Open Source and learning new things everyday. Also I have met a lot of new people, which some of them have made an impact in my daily life.

### Life

I've introduced a **new habit of running** _(3-4 days per week)_ 🏃 to maintain a healthy life. Also this helps me to **refresh** and **clear my mind** when I'm a stressed out 🔥. Doing sports activity it's now a must for me.

### Open Source

**Open Source** projects **built in 2016**:

- [**gitmoji**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji): An emoji guide for your commit messages. 😜
- [**gitmoji-cli**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli): A gitmoji interactive client for using emojis on commits. 💻
- [**carloscuesta.me**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/carloscuesta.me): Carlos Cuesta personal website. 🌍
- [**hyper-materialshell**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/hyper-materialshell): A material design theme for Hyper based on materialshell. ✨

I'm very happy with **gitmoji**, a project that has become popular on GitHub (_was one of the first trending GitHub repositories for a few days_ ✌️) and people found it useful for their own projects. Now having more than +1300 ⭐️.

Creating a popular Open Source project to experience the contributions, issues and pull requests was one of the main goals for the year! 💪

Even though it's not a big list, I've been maintaining all the previous projects created in 2015. In total I've made **847 contributions** in 2016.

### Trips

This year I've visited the **city** of **Stockholm** 🇸🇪 for **Christmas** and I absolutely loved it! 😍. Such a beautiful city to stay and live I would say. I will be going into Stockholm again in **summer** ☀️. Probably I'll be making a blog post to share some photos and thoughts.

### The future

For 2017 I want to do more things that make me happy:

- Drive more often and do road trips.
- Write more articles.
- Learn new things and technologies.
- Travel to discover new places.
- Create a lot of Open Source projects.

**Can not wait for 2017!** Let's go for it 😎
