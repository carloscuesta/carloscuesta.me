**[ReactiveConf](https://reactiveconf.com)** is a two days conference about functional and reactive programming that takes place in Bratislava 🇸🇰, at the [_Old Market Hall_](https://www.visitbratislava.com/places/old-market-hall/). I attended the conference with three workmates from **[Ulabox](https://ulabox.com)**, [@sospedra_r](https://twitter.com/sospedra_r), [@juanmaorta](https://twitter.com/juanmaorta) and [@markcial](https://twitter.com/Markcial). The venue was organized in two stages: the **Main Stage** and the **Discovery Stage**.

### Getting started

The conference day started with the registration, a backpack with a cool t-shirt, socks and stickers was given to every attendee.

### Venue and talks

The **Old Market** was a **comfortable** and **big** place to watch the Main Stage talks. Upstairs there was a big space with TV's to follow the live-stream, a ton of bean bags and a few XBOX's to play with 🎮.

**Discovery Stage** was located in another place called [Ateliér Babylon](https://goo.gl/maps/26uvWrAnDhv), within a **5 minute walk** from the **Old Market Hall**. This stage was **too small**, at the second day we had to turn back to the Old Market, due to the lack of space, losing the opportunity to watch the _"Understanding Webpack from inside out"_ talk. 👎

The **food** was **very nice** 🍗. A few serving points were distributed along the Market Hall. Also, the schedule was very well planned the number of breaks helped to follow the presentations easily!

In terms of **talks** the **quality** and technical **level** was **good**. But with some speakers I thought that they were selling us their product instead of training us. Also I noticed that some talks, IMHO were offtopic according to the _Reactive_ paradigm.

Having said that, these are my favourite talks ⭐️:
