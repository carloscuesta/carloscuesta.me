Hey! 👋 It's been a while since I went to a in-person conference, _last one was in 2017_ 😱 almost 6 years ago! 🤯

This time I travelled all the way down to Miami 🇺🇸 from Barcelona 🇪🇸 for **[React Miami](https://reactmiami.com)** 🌴, a two days conference about React that took place at the **[Miami Beach Convention Center](https://www.miamibeachconvention.com/)**.

### Venue

The convention center is located very close to the beach, so you can enjoy the sun and the sea while you're at the conference 🌴

Finding the registration desk was tricky because the place is huge, but once there, everything was easy and smooth. React Miami probably has the best **swag** I've seen in a conference, the designs of the t-shirt and stickers are awesome! 😍

The conference was organized in a **single track** which is **great** because you can **attend all the talks** you want without having to choose between them. The schedule was very well made with a good balance between talks and breaks.

The **food** was delicious and tasty, I had a great time eating Mexican 🌮 and Chinese 🍜 food. Snacks and drinks were available all day long 🍹, which is always a plus! 🙌

We also had a break-out room to chill and talk with other attendees, it was a nice place to meet people.

### Talks

The quality of the **talks** and the technical level was very good, in-depth and detailed talks about React, CSS, Accessibility, Performance...

I have to say though, that it was very refreshing to see there was a big focus around **mental/developer health** a topic that is not mentioned enough in conferences and it's something we should all be more aware of.

Having said that, here's the list of my favourite talks ❤️ in no particular order:

I was attending the conference on my own, but everyone was super friendly and welcoming, it **felt like home** 🙏.
