### How to get HTTPs

To get HTTPs for your website, you need a **certificate** signed by a trusted certificate authority, and you will pay for that process. But with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) you can get easily and free **HTTPs** for your site *(which currently, is what i'm using for my website and blog)*.

#### Let's get started!

First, if you are not registered, [create an account in Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/a/sign-up) it's easy and free!.

After that you will need to add your site to Cloudflare introducing your URL. Cloudflare will start to scan your website DNS, choose the **free plan** and **point** your **domain Nameservers** to the ones provided by Cloudflare, e.g:

```language-shell
iris.ns.cloudflare.com
beau.ns.cloudflare.com
```

Once the process is complete, at the `Overview` tab you will see a green bar with your site and **Status: Active**. *Note: This process can take up to 24 hours to complete.*

Now, go to the `Crypto` tab and at the **SSL** section select **Flexible**.

At this point your HTTPs will be generated and available for your site.

Finally, create a **page rule** to enforce and redirect your users to use the **HTTPs version** inside of the `Page Rules` tab. Add the pattern URL to match your site and enable the option **Always use https**.
