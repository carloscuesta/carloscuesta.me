Hi I'm **Carlos Cuesta**, welcome to my new [website](http://carloscuesta.me) and [blog](http://carloscuesta.me/blog)!

Let me introduce myself, I am a **Front End developer** based in _Barcelona, Spain_. Coding addicted that enjoys building things with code, I like design, tecnhology and I ♥ [OpenSource](http://github.com/carloscuesta).

With the beginning of this new year, I think it's time to start a new project for me, my own _website_ and _blog_, of course it's **opensource**, so you can take a look at the code [right there at the github repository](https://github.com/carloscuesta/carloscuesta.me).

This whole website it's built on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) with Express, Jade, SASS and Ghost as a blog system and most of the data that is shown at the [homepage](http://carloscuesta.me) is _fetched_ from [GitHub](https://api.github.com), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) and [Ghost](https://api.ghost.org) APIs, so all the info will be updated every day **automatically**!

In my blog I'll be talking about a lot of things related to the **front end development** such as: _JavaScript_, _CSS_ (and preprocessors), _HTML_ (and templating systems), _Web Performance_, _Tools_, _Workflows_, and much more!

To finish my first post, all I want to say is the first thing that a developer makes when he writes his first lines of code.

```js
console.log('Hello World!')
```
