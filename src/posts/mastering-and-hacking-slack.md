title: "Mastering and Hacking Slack integrations"
---

I'm an active user of [Slack](https://slack.com/) since last year and I've been using it at work, with developer groups and friends. Two months ago **I figured out how Slack could improve my daily life**, boosting up my productivity and organization. Let's get started.

First, I decided to **create my own Slack channel** where I'm the only real person. *Even though the purpose of Slack it's the communication.*

> The main objective for this channel was to serve as a personal dashboard sending useful information.

As soon as you have a bunch of different projects with **Continuous Integration**, **Code Coverage**, **Deploys** and **Tasks** to track and do, you can't not stare to the different websites to check the statuses of all the processes, that's not productive.

This is what I use **every day** related to **development**.

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
* [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
* [Trello](https://www.trello.com)

There is a lot of cool stuff you can do with the [slack integrations](https://slack.com/apps), just search for the apps or services you're using to make slack even better.

After that I've ended up with these channels and integrations.

*Code Climate, GitHub, Heroku, IFTTT, Statsbot, Travis CI, Trello Alerts and Coveralls*

#### `#general` `#social`

Random stuff, such as weather forecasts and other information. Social related notifications, **twitter**.


In the end It's all about having the tools in one place, in my use case I'm even in the free plan, so that's not bad at all!
