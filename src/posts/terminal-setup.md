**Terminal** is a place where a developer spends a lot of time, running commands, looking for outputs and doing a bunch of stuff, so better to stay comfortable and productive with it.

### Shell

I use [**ZSH**](http://www.zsh.org) as my main shell along with [**Oh-My-Zsh**](http://ohmyz.sh). By default, OS X comes with bash, a simpler shell. To setup ZSH and install Oh-My-Zsh run:

```language-bash
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

To see what shell are you using run:

```language-bash
$ echo $SHELL
```

### UI

After setting up ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh, now we are ready to customize and put our shell on steroids.

I use a theme called [**materialshell**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/materialshell) that I've made for my own.

### Dotfiles

I have my own [**dotfiles repository**](https://github.com/carloscuesta/dotfiles) with all my shell configuration files, where you can take a look to learn and be more productive with your shell.
