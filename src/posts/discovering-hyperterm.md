[Hyper](http://hyper.is) is an **Open Source** Project created by [▲ ZEIT](https://zeit.co/). The goal of the project is to create a beautiful and extensible experience for command-line interface users, built on open web standards.

Hyper is built on top of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) with **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**, **so it's a hackable terminal!**

At the moment, Hyper is only available for [MacOS – download here](https://hyperterm-updates.now.sh/download/osx), Windows and Linux builds are coming very soon.

Considering that is something built with web technologies, in my opinion it has a **good performance and speed** and there's no big difference for me between using iTerm vs HyperTerm.

> This is how my HyperTerm looks. I'm using the **materialshell** version **for HyperTerm** [hyperterm-materialshell](https://github.com/carloscuesta/hyperterm-materialshell)

**Developing plugins** (themes and packages) **it's easy**, with `ALT+CMD+I` you can open the Web Inspector to see what's going under the hood and style your terminal with only **CSS**. Take a look at the [configuration object](https://hyperterm.org/#cfg) to see the options and properties available for customization.

See an example of an Hyper [theme](https://github.com/zeit/hyperpower) and [package](https://github.com/zeit/hyperyellow). You should take this as a starting point when building one of those two.

To install a plugin, open the configuration file with `CMD+,` and add the plugin name into your `plugins` list like this:

```language-javascript
plugins: ['hyperterm-materialshell']
```

Remember! You can contribute to HyperTerm in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zeit/hyper).
